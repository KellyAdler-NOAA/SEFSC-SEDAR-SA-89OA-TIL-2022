**Topical Working Groups**:
  + Week of January 22, 2024; Life History Topical Working Group Webinar I
  + Week of February 12, 2024; Life History Topical Working Group Webinar II
  + Week of March 11, 2024; Life History Topical Working Group Webinar III

**Year range**: YYYY-YYYY (Previous Assessment: YYYY-YYYY)

**Commercial**:  
  + *Boundary*: Statistical grids 1-21, North of US Highway 1 in the Florida Keys and North of the boundary line that extends from Key West to the Dry Tortugas
      + Specify subareas 744.001, 748.001, etc.
      + Include table of subareas to include? Particularly relevant for south Florida
  + *Fleet structure*: (1) Commercial Gillnet (+ Other), (2) Commercial Handlines (+ Other)
  ("Other" gears apportioned among Gillnet and Handline gears based on the annual proportions of landings by those two gears.)
      + Specify if this aggregation holds for length and age compositions (or if other/unknown gears are excluded)
      + Include table of fleet aggregations using FIN gear codes?
  + *Landings units*: Pounds whole weight

**Recreational**:  
  + *Boundary*: Gulf of Mexico states from Texas to the Florida Keys at the Dade-Monroe County line
  + *Fleet structure*: (1) Recreational modes combined (Charter, Private, Shore and Headboat)  
      + Where relevant, include distinction between shore/private as some surveys (LA Creel) do not distinguish between these modes  
  + *Landings units*: Number of fish , pounds whole weight (indicate if one or both are requested)

**Indices**:  
  + *Recreational (MRFSS/MRIP) Index*: Number of fish caught per angler hour
  + *FWC Trip Ticket Vertical Line Index*: Pounds per trip    
  + *SEAMAP Independent Fishery Trawl Survey Index*: Full model incorporating summer and fall datasets, number of fish per trawl hour
  + *Shrimp Bycatch Fishery Effort Time Series*: Days fished

**Composition Data Input Sample Sizes**: Number of trips, number of fish (indicate if one or both are requested)

**Length Bins and Units**: 4 cm fork length (FL) - 100 cm FL in 2 cm bins (indicate if lower inclusive or midpoints are requested--currently, GM is lower inclusive and SA is midpoint)

**Ages**: 0-11 years with 11 as plus group for compositions
